# Hellow_World
This is my first program (or repository) on Github, nice to meet you!!! 

Hi, every 大佬 (or so-called big shot in English, maybe) in Github!

I'm a college freshman from SCUT, China, PLEASE forgive my poor English.
I have heard this best open scoures web for a long time, but I sign up my Github account today.
I am new in C++ for 4 months, and I want to learn Python in winter holiday since my team will join MCM/ICM.
I hope I can learn something new here, and also leave something helpful to others here.
nice to meet you again!
